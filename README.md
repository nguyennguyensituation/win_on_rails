### Who is your biggest fan?

If you were up for a big promotion, who would you want to be your hypeman? Your boss? Your best friend? Or someone else?

Your boss or bestie might be lovely people, but when it comes to advocating for yourself, the best advocate for you is *you*. No one knows your work as well as you do. But when you sit down to update your resumÃ© or write a performance review, it can be hard to remember everything that you've accomplished in the last quarter or the last year, much less the last few years.

### What is Nguyen Streak?

**Nguyen Streak** is an app to track your wins. Instead of digging through stacks of old emails, documents, and DMs, Nguyen Streak makes it easier to keep all your accomplishments in one place.
